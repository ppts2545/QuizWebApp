Your `Planning` folder covers a **very solid foundation** for the backend of a Quiz Web App. Here’s what you have and what you might still need:

---

### **What you already cover:**

- **Account Management:**  
  - Create, login, signup, Google login, forgot/reset password, security (rate limiting, HTTPS, JWT).
- **Room Management:**  
  - Create room (with admin check), join room (with JWT verification, room/quiz existence, access control).
- **Quiz Management:**  
  - Admin creates quizzes in rooms, sets questions, collects answers, sets time limits.
- **Quiz Taking:**  
  - Players do quizzes, timeouts, default answers, answer collection.
- **Scoring & Ranking:**  
  - Calculate score (with/without time), ranking by score, display ranking.
- **Security:**  
  - JWT verification, rate limiting, HTTPS enforcement.

### **What you might still need or clarify:**

1. **Quiz CRUD for Admin:**  
   - Add/edit/delete questions and answers in a room.
   - Set quiz as "ready" for players.

2. **Real-time Features:**  
   - WebSocket or polling for live updates (e.g., live leaderboard, quiz start/end, real-time answer submission).

3. **Player Management:**  
   - Track who joined, left, or is currently in a room.
   - Prevent duplicate joins.

4. **Quiz State Management:**  
   - Start/stop quiz, move to next question, handle quiz end.

5. **Data Models:**  
   - Define MongoDB (or SQL) schemas for users, rooms, quizzes, questions, answers, results, logs.

6. **API Endpoints:**  
   - REST or WebSocket endpoints for all actions (create room, join, submit answer, get quiz, get leaderboard, etc.).

7. **Admin Controls:**  
   - Ability to kick users, reset room, delete room, etc.

8. **Audit & Logging:**  
   - Log important actions for security and debugging.

9. **Email/Notification System:**  
   - For invites, results, password resets, etc.

**Conclusion:**  
Your pseudocode covers all the core backend logic for a quiz web app.  
For a production-ready backend, you’ll want to expand on quiz CRUD, real-time features, data models, and API endpoints.  
But for planning and starting development, your current folder is a strong foundation!
