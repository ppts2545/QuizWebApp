technology we need
	- WebSockets = WebSockets allow your server and browser to "talk to each other" in real-time, without the user needing to refresh the page.

	-Database = Instead of just storing quiz data in memory (which disappears when the server restarts), store everything in a database, so itâ€™s saved permanently.
	
	-frontend frameworks = Instead of using plain HTML, you can use React to build interactive, smooth web interfaces.
